# Reverse Shell Generator

This is a very basic script that will generate certain reverse shell with your desired input. 

There are two versions. Obviously the original and then a stripped down more functional version that has things such as the welcome message and prompts removed to make it more streamlined. 

Currently it can generate reverse shell's in bash, perl & python. I intend to add more as time goes on.
