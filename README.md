# Reverse Shell Generator

This is a very basic script that will generate certain reverse shell with your desired input. 

There are two versions. Obviously the original and then a stripped down more functional version that has things such as the welcome message and prompts removed to make it more streamlined. 

Currently it can generate reverse shell's in Bash, PERL, Python, PHP, Ruby, Golang & Powershell.

It will also automatically add the outputted shell to your clipboard.
